# Battleship
Another surprisingly challenging project from The Odin Project.
The description of the assignment is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship). The live demo is [here](https://nhsegal.github.io/battleship/).

The game logic was written using test driven development and unit tests were written using Jest.
